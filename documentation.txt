The following application will help you browse the data about foreign residents in the Lombardy region of Italy from the OpenData project (https://www.dati.lombardia.it).

Begin by selecting which features you would like to include and exclude from the analysis by checking and unchecking the approriate checkboxes in the widget below.
The parameters you could work on are: the area districts (the Lombardy region is divided in 12 provinces, more information on wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lombardy
), the age range of the foreign residents and their sex (male and/or female). Instead, the slider will help you selecting the range of years to be analyzed (at the present time the dataset includes information from year 2011 to year 2016).

As soon as you are satisfied, switch to one of the other two tabs: *"Plot"* will display a graphical representation of the number of foreign residents, the *"Table"* tab will shows the same information in a tabular format.
The widgets will remain anchored at the bottom of the page so you might change some of the parameters without getting back to this page: the related plot and data table will be updated "on the fly" according to your choices.

In case you would like to read the documentation again, click on the "istruction" tab to get back to this page.
